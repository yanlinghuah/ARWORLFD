# AR Project: Marker Detection and Plane Detection

## Project Overview
This project is an AR application that includes **Marker Detection** and **Plane Detection** functionalities. It features image recognition through markers, a simple interface, and audio feedback for marker-based interactions. The plane detection functionality allows the user to detect surfaces and place a 3D animated character (Doraemon) that dances on the detected plane.

## Features

### 1. Marker Detection
- **Functionality**: The marker detection system recognizes a predefined image and displays a simple user interface along with audio feedback.
- **Implementation**: The marker detection component was developed following the tutorial from Unity's AR project learning platform. The reference tutorial can be found [here](https://learn.unity.com/project/create-a-marker-based-ar-app?uv=2021.3).
- **Audio**: Upon successful detection, an audio cue is played.

### 2. Plane Detection and Character Placement
- **Functionality**: This feature uses AR's plane detection technology to detect flat surfaces, where users can place a 3D animated character of **Doraemon**.
- **Animation**: The dancing animation for Doraemon was sourced from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/), while the 3D model was acquired from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/).
- **Custom Code**: The code that handles the plane detection, character placement, and interaction logic is written by myself.

## Tools and Resources Used
- **Unity**: The AR foundation for building both marker detection and plane detection.
- **Mixamo**: For acquiring pre-made animations.
- **Sketchfab**: For obtaining the Doraemon 3D character model.


## Credits
- **Unity Tutorial**: Referenced [Create a Marker-based AR App](https://learn.unity.com/project/create-a-marker-based-ar-app?uv=2021.3) for marker detection.
- **Mixamo**: For providing free 3D animations.
- **Sketchfab**: For the Doraemon model.
